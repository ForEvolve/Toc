## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of the project you are in, do one of the following:

- If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
- If your contribution is major, such as a new feature, start by opening an issue first. That way, your idea can be validated and approved, and other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

### Contributing a translation to `ForEvolve.AspNetCore.Localization`

- If you are not sure what to do about a translation, start by opening an issue first.
- If you want to contribute a full translation, open a pull request.
